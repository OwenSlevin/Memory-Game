# Memory-Game

This is a card game where all of the cards start facing downwards. The first player will then be required to select two cards from the board. Once the card has been clicked on it will flip over revealing the photo from underneath. If the cards are a match the user will recieve a point, but if its not a match then the cards will turn face down again and it will be users 2's turn. This process will be repeated until all of the cards have been matched and the user with the highest score at the end will win the game.

The cards are also randomly layed out every game to ensure that every game is different.
